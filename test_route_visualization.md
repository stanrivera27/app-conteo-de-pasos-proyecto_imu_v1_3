# Route Visualization Test Instructions

## Testing the Blue Route Fix

### What was fixed:
1. **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track path calculation and rendering
2. **Improved Polyline Rendering**: Enhanced `_buildSafePolylines()` with better visibility and border
3. **Fallback Path Calculation**: Added direct D* Lite calculation if background processor fails  
4. **Better Error Handling**: Added validation for start/goal nodes and path results
5. **Layer Rendering Order**: Optimized layer order to ensure route visibility
6. **Visual Feedback**: Added route status indicator in UI

### Test Steps:

1. **Launch the Application**
   - Open the map screen
   - Wait for initialization to complete
   - Check that you see "Grid: âœ“" in diagnostic info

2. **Test Basic Route Calculation**
   - Tap on the map to set a start point (green marker should appear)
   - Tap on another location to set an end point (red marker should appear)  
   - You should see "Calculando ruta..." message
   - A blue route line should appear connecting the two points

3. **Verify Route Visibility**
   - The route should be a thick blue line (6px width) with white border (8px)
   - Route should be visible above grid lines but below navigation markers
   - Check the route status indicator shows "Ruta: X puntos" in green

4. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Try setting start and end points in the same cell (should show error)
   - Try setting points on obstacles (should show accessibility error)
   - Reset with refresh button and try different routes

5. **Debug Information**
   - Check Flutter console logs for detailed debug output
   - Look for "=== CALCULATING ROUTE ===" and "=== BUILDING POLYLINES ===" messages
   - Verify path coordinates are generated correctly

### Expected Console Output:
```
=== MAP TAP EVENT ===
=== CALCULATING ROUTE ===
Start point: LatLng(6.2415, -75.5885)
Goal point: LatLng(6.2418, -75.5875)
Start cell: Point(5, 15)
Goal cell: Point(8, 25)
Ruta encontrada: 12 nodos
Path coordinates generated: 12 points
=== BUILDING POLYLINES ===
Path length: 12
Adding route polyline with 12 points
Route polyline added successfully
Route border added for enhanced visibility
```

### If the route still doesn't appear:
1. Check if `path.length > 1` in debug logs
2. Verify coordinates are within map bounds
3. Check layer rendering order in Flutter Inspector
4. Ensure polyline color contrast is sufficient

### Performance Notes:
- Background processor initialization may take a moment
- Fallback to direct calculation ensures route always computes
- RepaintBoundary widgets optimize rendering performance
